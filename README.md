An attempt at making an electronic version of a sundial. 
There will probably be two components to this:
- A "Stepper motor server" being driven via an M5Atom-matrix, although any esp32 would work
- A "Stepper client" that will read light values and instruct the server how far to rotate after each reading

This is a work in progress
